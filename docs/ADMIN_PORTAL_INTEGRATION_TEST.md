# Admin Portal Integration Test Plan

## Critical Fix Required

The Admin Portal was incorrectly implemented with hardcoded sidebar items instead of connecting to the existing Super Admin permission assignment system. This violates the core architecture principle.

## Correct Flow (Super Admin → Admin Portal)

### 1. Super Admin Creates Admin User
- Navigate to Super Admin Dashboard (Port 3003)
- Go to User Management → Add User
- Create user with:
  - Role: Admin
  - Assigned App: Admin Portal
  - Primary Branch: Selected branch
  - Permissions: Assigned via Permission Assignment page

### 2. Super Admin Assigns Microservice Permissions
- Navigate to Permission Assignment page
- Select the admin user
- Assign specific microservices (e.g., accounting-management, payment-processing)
- Save permissions

### 3. Admin User Logs Into Admin Portal
- Navigate to Admin Portal (Port 3002)
- Login with admin credentials
- Sidebar should show ONLY microservices assigned by Super Admin
- No hardcoded items should appear

## Current Issues Fixed

1. ✅ Removed hardcoded ALL_SIDEBAR_ITEMS array
2. ✅ Connected to existing authentication service (Port 8085)
3. ✅ Integrated with identity-access API for permission retrieval
4. ✅ Added proper Super Admin permission verification
5. ✅ Implemented dynamic sidebar generation based on assigned microservices

## Test Verification

1. **Authentication Flow**: Admin login redirects correctly
2. **Permission Loading**: Sidebar items match Super Admin assignments
3. **Branch Isolation**: Data filtered by assigned branch
4. **Security**: Unauthorized access properly blocked
5. **Database Integration**: All operations use existing schema

## API Endpoints Fixed

- `/api/admin/auth/login` - Verifies admin portal assignment
- `/api/admin/permissions` - Fetches Super Admin assigned microservices
- `/api/admin/branches` - Gets user's assigned branches
- `/api/admin/dashboard/*` - Branch-specific dashboard data

The Admin Portal now properly respects the three-tier architecture:
**Super Admin** (controls) → **Admin Portal** (managed) → **User Portal** (restricted)
