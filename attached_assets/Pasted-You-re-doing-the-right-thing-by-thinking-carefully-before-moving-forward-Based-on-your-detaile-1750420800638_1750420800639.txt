You're doing the right thing by thinking carefully before moving forward.

✅ Based on your detailed architecture description, here is the analysis + recommendation for your multi-branch, multi-role setup:
✅ What’s Already Good
✅ 1. Centralized Authentication Microservice

    JWT-based split auth (customer/internal) is perfect for multi-role systems.

    Distinct endpoints for /auth/customer and /auth/internal is ideal.

    Well-prepared for secure branching logic.

✅ 2. Zustand Auth Stores per Frontend

    Customer auth for ecommerce-web and ecommerce-mobile.

    Internal user auth for admin-portal.

    Super Admin unrestricted access – well-separated.

    Good session persistence logic in place.

✅ 3. Multi-Branch Data Architecture

    Every table has a branch_id: ✅ proper separation.

    Role-based access that restricts managers to their branch: ✅ correct security.

✅ 4. Frontend-to-Backend Auth Logic

    Admins/managers see only their branch's data.

    Customers see their nearest branch (or chosen one) – very smart.

✅ 5. Real-Life Usage Scenarios

    Customer flow and internal operations are thoughtfully split.

    Location-based pricing and product visibility: ✅ excellent for business.

⚠️ What Needs a Final Streamline

Here’s how you should finalize and lock the roles and apps:
App	Purpose	Audience	Access Scope	Required Features
ecommerce-web	Desktop shopping site	Customer	Branch-specific	Cart, checkout, order history
ecommerce-mobile	PWA mobile app	Customer	Branch-specific	Same as above (mobile-first)
admin-portal	Admin interface	Branch Admins, Managers	Assigned branch only	Inventory, orders, staff
ops-delivery	Delivery team	Employees/Delivery	Assigned branch	Delivery status, maps
super-admin	HQ admin portal	Founders/Admins	Full company-wide	Add branches, users, analytics

Each of these apps already has a solid structure — you just need to finish:

    RBAC filtering for every API (backend layer)

    UI enforcement of roles (frontend sidebar/menu, page-level protection)

    Geo-based branch detection + override (already partly implemented)

🔒 Lock These Rules (Recommended)

If you're moving forward:

    Finalize a user.roles enum in shared schema

    Lock down routing logic in frontend: if role !== admin → redirect

    Add one RBAC middleware to all backend controllers (decorator-based)

    Lock Zustand stores as you’ve done — ✅ already listed in README.DEV.md

    Add a branch_users table (user_id + branch_id + role) for flexibility

📦 Do You Need Anything Else?

Only one recommendation:
Add a subscription-service microservice (backend) to handle:

    Daily/Weekly/Monthly meal subscriptions

    Auto-renewal, pause, cancel, retry logic

    Billing & plan tracking (tied to customer + branch)

This could feed directly into your order-management service using event-based triggers.
✅ Final Summary

Your current design is:

    🎯 Enterprise-ready

    🔐 Secure with strong role isolation

    📱 Multi-app friendly (mobile, admin, super-admin)

    📦 Scalable for new branches
