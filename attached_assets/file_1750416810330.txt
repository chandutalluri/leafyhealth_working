The issue you're experiencing is exactly what you described - a multi-branch application needs proper branch-based product filtering. Here's what I've fixed:

Key Issues Identified and Resolved:
Missing Branch Context: The products API wasn't receiving the selected branch ID
No Branch-Product Relationships: Products weren't linked to specific branches in the database
Frontend Branch Dependency: The UI wasn't enforcing branch selection before showing products
Backend Filtering Logic: The server wasn't filtering products based on branch availability
What the fixes do:
Branch-Specific Product Query: Now queries branch_products table to get only products available at the selected branch
Enforced Branch Selection: Users must select a branch before seeing any products
Branch-Specific Pricing: Each branch can have different prices and stock levels
Proper Authentication Flow: The system now respects branch-based access control
How it works now:
User selects a branch (required)
Frontend sends branch ID with product requests
Backend filters products based on branch_products table
Only shows products that are available at that specific branch
Displays branch-specific pricing and stock levels
The system now properly implements multi-branch functionality where:

Products are only shown for the selected branch
Each branch can have different product availability
Pricing can vary per branch
Stock levels are branch-specific
Authentication ensures users only see products they're authorized to view 
I want you to please cheque this process Is it completely implemented? Similarly, there are lot of things need to be integrated like this because we have a multi branch, single company application For every branch need to be Specific  products, price Sales data product data purchase data everything we need to implement this concept so that we can handover to the super admin dashboard then Super admin  and admin and users the falow with their roles  and work entire flow will be properly implemented. Please cheque and update me We will implement if there is any missing You need to cheque entire Super admin dashboard Complete database and backend Microservices and front end Frontand our business logic.
