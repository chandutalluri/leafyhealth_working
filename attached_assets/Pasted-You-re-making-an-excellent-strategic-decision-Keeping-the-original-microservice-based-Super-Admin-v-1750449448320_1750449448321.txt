You're making an excellent strategic decision. Keeping the original microservice-based Super Admin view for developers and system owners is wise — while introducing a business-domain based “Operational Super Admin” panel for functional users (admins, managers, etc.) creates clarity and professionalism.
✅ GOAL

Create an Operational Super Admin Dashboard based on Business Domains, not technical services.
And introduce Customizable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) that works across:

    A single company

    Multiple branches

    Nested team roles (Owner, Admin, Manager, Staff)

    Dynamic business domains (not just technical services)

🔐 Step-by-Step Plan: Role and Permission System for Business-Domain Based Control
🔁 Core Principle:

    "Users are granted permissions to features, not to microservices."

📦 1. Define Role Types
Role	Level	Access Scope	Example Use Case
Super Admin	Global	Full access to all business domains + branches	SaaS platform owner
Company Admin	Company-wide	Access to all branches and modules	Head of operations
Branch Admin	Per-branch	Restricted to specific branch data	Guntur branch manager
Ops Manager	Per-module	Can manage specific modules like Orders, Finance	Finance head, Delivery manager
Staff	Minimal	View or limited control	Call center, packaging, delivery staff
🧩 2. Map Roles → Business Domains (Composite Modules)

Let’s define what modules each role can access and what permissions they have inside.
Module	super_admin	company_admin	branch_admin	ops_manager	staff
Products	Full CRUD	Full CRUD	View + Edit	Custom	View
Orders	Full	Full	View + Update	Full	View
Inventory	Full	Full	Update only	Full	-
Subscriptions	Full	Full	Full	-	View
Customers	Full	View + Edit	View	-	View
Analytics	Full	View Reports	View own	View own	-
Finance	Full	View + Export	-	View own	-
Company / Branch	Full	View + Add	View	-	-
Users / Roles	Full	Add Staff	-	-	-

    You can later fine-tune these to granular feature levels (like edit-only, export-only, upload-only).

🧱 3. Define Data Ownership Hierarchy

    Global Super Admin → Accesses all companies (multi-tenant if needed)

    Company Admin → Accesses all branches under that company

    Branch Admin → Accesses only their branch (via branch_id)

    Permissions are enforced at:

        JWT level: Embed role, branch_id, company_id

        Frontend UI level: canAccess('orders.edit')

        Backend Guard level: Custom @Roles(), @BranchRestricted() decorators

🔐 4. RBAC Backend Design (in PostgreSQL)

-- roles table
id | name           | description
---|----------------|------------------
1  | super_admin    | Platform owner
2  | company_admin  | Admin for company
3  | branch_admin   | Manages one branch
4  | ops_manager    | Operates one module
5  | staff          | Limited view access

-- permissions table
id | module         | action        | description
---|----------------|---------------|---------------------------
1  | products       | view          | View products
2  | products       | create        | Add new products
3  | orders         | update        | Update order status
...

-- role_permissions
role_id | permission_id
--------|----------------
1       | 1
1       | 2
2       | 1
...

-- users table
id | email          | role_id | branch_id | company_id
---|----------------|---------|-----------|------------
1  | super@leafy.in | 1       | null      | null
2  | ops@guntur.in  | 3       | 22        | 5

🧠 5. Dynamic Frontend Permissions (Zustand Store)

Create a usePermissionStore():

export const usePermissionStore = create((set) => ({
  role: null,
  permissions: [],
  can: (module: string, action: string) => {
    return permissions.includes(`${module}.${action}`);
  },
  hydratePermissions: async () => {
    const res = await fetch('/api/auth/permissions');
    const data = await res.json();
    set({ role: data.role, permissions: data.permissions });
  }
}));

Then in your components:

const { can } = usePermissionStore();
{can('products', 'edit') && <ProductEditForm />}

🏢 6. Operational Super Admin Dashboard Sidebar Example

const businessModules = [
  { name: 'Products', icon: <PackageIcon />, route: '/products' },
  { name: 'Orders', icon: <CartIcon />, route: '/orders' },
  { name: 'Customers', icon: <UsersIcon />, route: '/customers' },
  { name: 'Subscriptions', icon: <RepeatIcon />, route: '/subscriptions' },
  { name: 'Finance', icon: <BankIcon />, route: '/finance' },
  { name: 'Analytics', icon: <ChartBarIcon />, route: '/analytics' },
];

→ Sidebar will only render routes that the user has access to.
🧩 Summary
Area	Recommendation
Microservices in Sidebar	❌ Avoid in operational dashboard – too complex
Business-Domain Grouping	✅ Yes. Group services into 6-8 functional modules
Permissions	✅ Role-based per business module
Frontend Enforcement	✅ Use Zustand and role-permissions per module
Backend Enforcement	✅ Use decorators with role/branch validation
User Simplicity	✅ Unified forms with multiple service calls (abstracted from user)
Technical Flexibility	✅ Supports fine-grained control as app grows
