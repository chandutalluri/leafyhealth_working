What I Understand:
Current Issue: The system isn't properly implementing branch-specific data filtering across all modules. Each branch needs its own:

Products with different prices and availability
Sales data and analytics
Purchase records and inventory
Customer data and orders
Payment transactions
Subscription management
User access controls
Required Implementation:

Branch-Specific Product Management - Each branch has different products, prices, and stock
Branch-Segregated Sales Analytics - Sales reports per branch for admin dashboards
Branch-Based User Access - Users only see data for their assigned branch
Branch-Specific Financial Data - Purchase orders, payments, revenue per branch
Role-Based Branch Access - Super Admin sees all branches, Branch Admin sees only their branch
Complete Data Isolation - No cross-branch data visibility unless authorized
My Implementation Plan:
Phase 1: Database Schema Enhancement

Add branch_id to all relevant tables (orders, payments, customers, inventory, etc.)
Create branch_products table with branch-specific pricing
Add user_branch_assignments for access control
Phase 2: Backend API Updates

Update all microservices to filter by branch_id
Implement branch-based authentication middleware
Add branch context to all API endpoints
Phase 3: Frontend Branch Integration

Enforce branch selection across all apps
Update all data requests to include branch context
Implement branch-specific dashboards
Phase 4: Role-Based Access Control

Super Admin: All branches access
Branch Admin: Single branch access
Users: Assigned branch only
This will create a complete multi-branch system where each branch operates independently with its own data, while Super Admin can oversee all branches.
