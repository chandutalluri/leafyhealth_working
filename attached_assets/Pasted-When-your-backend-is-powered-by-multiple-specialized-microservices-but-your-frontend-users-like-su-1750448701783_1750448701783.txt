When your backend is powered by multiple specialized microservices, but your frontend users (like super admins or admins) need to work with one logical task (e.g. product creation, inventory control, subscription setup), exposing raw microservices directly in the UI will cause:

    ❌ Confusion (users don't know which service to go to)

    ❌ Broken workflows (multiple disconnected steps)

    ❌ Poor UX (redundant sidebar items, overcomplicated UI)

✅ Industry-Standard Solution: Feature-Driven Composite Modules
💡 Concept: Group Microservices by Business Domain, not by Service

    ✅ 1 screen = 1 complete business workflow

    ❌ NOT 1 screen = 1 microservice

🔁 Example: "Product Management" Composite Module
Business Task	Internally uses Microservices	What the User Sees (UI)
Add/Edit Product	catalog-management, inventory-management, category-management, image-service	🧩 "Products" Page
Set Product Availability	inventory-management, branch-management	⚙️ Inventory Tab inside Product
Upload Product Image	image-service	📷 Upload Section
Assign to Category	category-management	📁 Category Dropdown

    👤 For the user, this all happens in ONE unified UI screen:
    “Add Product → Fill Details → Upload Image → Assign to Branch/Category → Save”

🧩 What You Should Implement: Composite Frontend Modules
Structure:

    Single Sidebar Entry: e.g. Products

    Single Route: /super-admin/products

    Single Zustand Store: useProductStore()

    Multiple Backend Calls in Background:

        GET /api/catalog/products

        GET /api/categories

        GET /api/branches

        POST /api/inventory/adjust

        etc.

🧠 How to Achieve This (Tech Stack Guidance)

    Use Custom React Hooks or Zustand Store
    Create a unified logic layer in frontend like:

    useProductService() → internally calls multiple microservices

    Backend Aggregation (Optional Advanced)
    If needed later, create backend aggregator microservices that combine logic.
    E.g. product-service aggregates from:

        catalog

        inventory

        image-service

    UI Abstraction
    The user sees ONE form, ONE table, ONE screen.

    RBAC on the Composite Module
    Only show this page if the user's role includes access to all required microservices.

✅ Your Super Admin Sidebar Should Be:
Section	Composed Of...
Products	catalog + inventory + image + categories
Orders	order-management + payment-processing + customer-service
Subscriptions	subscription + scheduling + notifications
Users & Roles	user-role-management + branch-management + company-management
Analytics	analytics-reporting + performance-monitor
Settings	content-management + delivery-zones + label-design
