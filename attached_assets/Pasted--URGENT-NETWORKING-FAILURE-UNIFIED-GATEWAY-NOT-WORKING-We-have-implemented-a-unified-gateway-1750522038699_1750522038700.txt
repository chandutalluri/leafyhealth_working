### ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT NETWORKING FAILURE: UNIFIED GATEWAY NOT WORKING

We have implemented a unified gateway networking architecture as documented in our internal file `UNIFIED_NETWORKING_ARCHITECTURE.md`. The following constraints and configs were previously working:

- All frontend and backend services are internally routed.
- External port exposed: `5000` (Unified Gateway)
- All other frontend ports (3000-3004) and backend ports (3013‚Äì3036, 8081, 8085) are internal.
- API routes follow: `https://your-domain:5000/api/[service]/[endpoint]`
- Admin portals via subpaths (e.g., `/login`, `/system-dashboard`, `/operational-dashboard`)

---

### ‚ùóCurrent Symptoms

- Port 5000 is either **not binding**, **not accessible**, or **not resolving** properly.
- Unified Gateway appears to **not reach backend services** anymore.
- No frontend or API routes are resolving ‚Äî even basic `/login` fails.
- Preview URLs show **network timeout** or Replit's generic error page.

---

### ‚úÖ Prior Stable Configuration (Before Failure)

**Reference**: `PRODUCTION_READINESS_REVIEW.md`
- Gateway served all frontend apps via sub-paths.
- Traefik/NGINX-style routing was unified behind port 5000.
- No direct frontend port exposure.
- Backend health checks and routing worked across 26 services.

### üîç Request for Assistance

Please help validate and/or restore:

1. Is Replit still allowing external access to **port 5000**?
2. Has **Replit networking changed** to block internal communication between services or containers?
3. Is there any sandboxing/policy change that affects:
   - Internal port discovery?
   - Service-to-service communication?
   - Outbound/inbound socket binding?
4. Can you provide current firewall or container logs for `5000`, `8085`, `3013`, etc.?

---

### Suggested Recovery Steps

- Revalidate that only port `5000` is exposed.
- Confirm internal port routing via unified gateway file (`unified-gateway.js`).
- Restart all containers manually from Replit Shell with logs enabled:
  ```bash
  pnpm start unified-gateway
