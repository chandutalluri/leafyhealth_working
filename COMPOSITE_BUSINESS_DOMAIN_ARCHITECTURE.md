## Data Architecture and Service Orchestration

### Service Orchestration Pattern
Each composite domain implements a service orchestration layer that:
- Coordinates multiple microservice calls
- Manages data consistency across services
- Handles error recovery and rollback scenarios
- Provides unified response formatting

### Example: Product Creation Workflow
```
User Action: Create New Product
↓
Frontend: Product Ecosystem Component
↓
Orchestration Layer:
  1. Create product record (catalog-management)
  2. Initialize inventory (inventory-management)
  3. Create category assignment (category-management)
  4. Generate placeholder images (image-management)
  5. Create label template (label-design)
↓
Response: Unified product object with all related data
```

### Data Consistency Strategy
- **Eventual Consistency:** Non-critical data synchronization
- **Strong Consistency:** Financial and inventory transactions
- **Compensating Transactions:** Error recovery for failed operations
- **Event Sourcing:** Audit trail for critical business operations

## Security and Compliance Implementation

### Authentication Strategy
- JWT tokens with embedded role and branch information
- Multi-factor authentication for administrative access
- Session management with automatic timeout
- API key management for service-to-service communication

### Data Privacy and Protection
